    "# Build a Customer Support Bot\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer support bots can free up teams' time by handling routine issues, but it can be hard to build a bot that reliably handles diverse tasks in a way that doesn't leave the user pulling their hair out.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will build a customer support bot for an airline to help users research and make travel arrangements. You'll learn to use LangGraph's interrupts and checkpointers and more complex state to organize your assistant's tools and manage a user's flight bookings, hotel reservations, car rentals, and excursions. It assumes you are familiar with the concepts presented in the [LangGraph introductory tutorial](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/introduction/).\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll have built a working bot and gained an understanding of  LangGraph's key concepts and architectures. You'll be able to apply these design patterns to your other AI projects.\n",

    "First, set up your environment. We'll install this tutorial's prerequisites, download the test DB, and define the tools we will reuse in each section.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using Claude as our LLM and define a number of custom tools. While most of our tools will connect to a local sqlite database (and require no additional dependencies), we will also provide a general web search to the agent using Tavily."

    "## Part 4: Specialized Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sections, we saw how \"wide\" chat-bots, relying on a single prompt and LLM to handle various user intents, can get us far. However, it's difficult to create **predictably great** user experiences for known intents with this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, your graph can detect userintent and select the appropriate workflow or \"skill\" to satisfy the user's needs. Each workflow can focus on its domain, allowing for isolated improvements without degrading the overall assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll split user experiences into separate sub-graphs, resulting in a structure like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- <img src=\"./img/part-4-diagram.png\" src=\"../img/part-4-diagram.png\"> -->\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram above, each square wraps an agentic, focused workflow. The primary assistant fields the user's initial queries, and the graph routes to the appropriate \"expert\" based on the query content.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### State\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to keep track of which sub-graph is in control at any given moment. While we _could_ do this through some arithmetic on the message list, it's easier to track as a dedicated **stack**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Add a `dialog_state` list to the `State` below. Any time a `node` is run and returns a value for `dialog_state`, the `update_dialog_stack` function will be called to determine how to apply the update."

    "1. `enter_*`: use the `create_entry_node` utility you defined above to add a ToolMessage signaling that the new specialized assistant is at the helm\n",
    "2. Assistant: the prompt + llm combo that takes in the current state and either uses a tool, asks a question of the user, or ends the workflow (return to the primary assistant)\n",
    "3. `*_safe_tools`: \"read-only\" tools the assistant can use without user confirmation.\n",
    "4. `*_sensitive_tools`: tools with \"write\" access that require user confirmation (and will be assigned an `interrupt_before` when we compile the graph)\n",
    "5. `leave_skill`: _pop_ the `dialog_state` to signal that the *primary assistant* is back in control\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You've now developed a customer support bot that handles diverse tasks using focused workflows.\n",
    "More importantly, you've learned to use some of LangGraph's core features to design and refactor an application based on your product needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above examples are by no means optimized for your unique needs - LLMs make mistakes, and each flow can be made more reliable through better prompts and experimentation. Once you've created your initial support bot, the next step would be to start [adding evaluations](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation) so you can confidently improve your system. Check out those docs and our other tutorials to learn more! -->"
